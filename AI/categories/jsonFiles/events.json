        "description": "Andrew Vanderburg, MIT\n\nAbstract: Over the past thirty years, astronomers have made extraordinary progress in detecting planets around other stars. We now know that stars commonly host planets with a wider range of physical properties and system architectures than exist in our own solar system, and that planets likely outnumber stars in our galactic neighborhood. Now, planet detection and characterization technologies have advanced to the point that it should be possible to search for signs of life in the atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets around Sun-like stars within a few decades. These observations will give us our first glimpse at how common – or rare – life is in the universe. However, before we can carry out these observations and understand the implications for the abundance of life outside the Solar system, we must first find the nearest habitable planets to observe, learn their detailed properties, and refine our understanding of habitability. In this talk, I will describe my group's work to fill in these knowledge gaps by developing new tools and methods to detect and characterize exoplanets. First, I will show how cutting-edge machine learning methods could help reveal the closest potentially habitable planets to Earth – ideal for biosignature searches in the 2040s. Next, I will show how we can learn about extrasolar geochemistry by studying planetary accretion onto white dwarf stars – allowing us to see whether geological processes important for habitability on Earth take place in other systems. And finally, I will describe our work to understand what happens to planets when stars run out of nuclear fuel and find out whether life can continue in a system after the host star's death."

        "description": "\"High-Resolution Analysis of Single Extracellular Vesicles and Particles with Digital Flow Cytometry\"\n\nAbstract: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a key role in intercellular communication by transporting a broad range of biomolecules, including RNAs and proteins. However, EVs are highly heterogeneous and extremely small, which makes their study highly challenging. To meet this challenge, we have developed a multi-parametric high-throughput flow-based method, which we termed digital flow cytometry (dFC), for the analysis of individual extracelluar vesicles and particles (EVPs). dFC provides single-fluorophore sensitivity and enables multiparameter characterization of EVPs, including sin¬gle-EVP phenotyping, the absolute quantitation of EVP concentrations, and biomarker copy numbers. dFC has a broad range of applications, from analysis of single EVPs such as exosomes or RNA-binding proteins to characterization of therapeutic lipid nano-particles, viruses, and proteins. dFC also provides absolute quantita¬tion of non-EVP samples such as dyes, beads, and Ab-dye conjugates. To complement dFC, we have also developed a high-throughput super-resolution method to calibrate dFC measured EV size. \nShort Biography: Daniel T. Chiu is the A. Bruce Montgomery Professor of Chemistry, Endowed Professor of Analytical Chemistry, Washington Research Foundation Professor, and Professor of Bioengineering at the University of Washington. He is a member of the Cancer Consortium at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. His research interests include nanomaterials, microfluidics, and new instrumentations for ultra-sensitive bioanalytical measurements. He obtained a B.A. in Neurobiology and a B.S. in Chemistry from UC Berkeley in 1993, then a Ph.D. in Chemistry from Stanford University in 1998. After completing postdoctoral research at Harvard University, he started in 2000 at the University of Washington. He is the author of more than 250 publications and is the inventor on over 250 issued patents."
