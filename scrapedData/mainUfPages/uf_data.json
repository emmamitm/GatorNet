Please check our event calendar for exact locations, times etc. Go Gators!Group CounselingDid you know that group counseling is as effective, and in some cases, more effective, than individual counseling? Group counseling provides students the opportunity to create a brave space to connect with a group of 4-10 students and 1-2 CWC counselors, typically meeting weekly for 1.5-2 hours. Through participating in group, students can gain insight into their own thoughts and behaviors, be inspired by each other’s growth, and offer/receive feedback and support!If you're interested in group counseling services, check out our groups page to see which will be active next semester, and then call us (352-392-1575) or access our online scheduling portal to schedule a brief consultation!
