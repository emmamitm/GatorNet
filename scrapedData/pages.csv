Each major’s core curriculum covers a range of subjects that provide the student with a solid foundation in their chosen field of study. Section Menu Undergraduate Catalog Administration Admission Academic Programs Colleges and Schools Majors Minors Certificates UF Online Majors UF Online Minors Academic Advising Student Responsibilities Academic Regulations Dates and Deadlines Student Life Courses Previous Catalogs Declaring a Major Changing Majors Upon entering UF as a freshman, students are encouraged to declare the major that they are most likely to pursue. Students may declare Exploratory if they are unsure. In their first few terms, students should take courses to explore multiple academic areas. Many students have varied interests and will graduate with minors, certificates, double majors, dual degrees or combination degrees. Exploring Areas of Interest Exploring areas of interest early helps students determine whether they want to pursue additional academic programs. In addition, quite a few students change majors in their first or second year, so exploring multiple areas early helps students to confirm their choice of major or identify a more desirable major. More Info Declaring an Exploratory Category First-year students with no major preference can declare one of three exploratory categories (humanities and letters, social and behavioral sciences, or science and engineering) for the first three Fall/Spring terms. Exploratory students are advised by the Academic Advising Center and affiliated with the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. Exploratory students should be purposeful in all of their decisions, particularly when it comes to choosing classes for each semester to be sure they are taking courses to explore potential majors. They must also actively work to narrow down UF majors to one that fits their aspirations and abilities. It's not unusual for students to change their minds about majors and career paths as they gain educational and practical experience. To help ensure that students make the best choices regarding their major and degree, UF provides guidance, information, and technical assistance. Students should proactively determine their major to obtain the degree that fits them best instead of being forced to select a major due to pending academic deadlines. There is often little relationship between undergraduate degrees and specific types of employment. A specific major does not guarantee employment in a specific field, nor does a specific major limit employment to a specific field. Ways to Explore Areas of Study at UF Review the Undergraduate Majors Students should search for majors that interest them and explore required courses; they should also speak to faculty or advisors in those departments. Use ONE.UF to Explore Majors by Subject Area, College, or Major Current students can use What-If reports in ONE.UF to discover if coursework they have taken applies toward a given major's requirements. For additional information, students should contact the department offering the degree or the advising office of the appropriate college. More Info Meet with an Academic Advisor Students can discuss majors and career options with an advisor in the college affiliated with their interests. More Info Utilize the Exploratory Website Students who are considering different majors can review advising suggestions, an exploratory timeline, resources, and tips on choosing a major. More Info Visit the Career Connections Center The Career Connections Center located on the first floor of the J. Wayne Reitz Union helps students make choices about their major and career. In addition to providing individual and group career counseling, the Career Connections Center library covers everything from accounting to zoology. Many other resources to explore careers are available through the website, including information about career planning and numerous helpful exercises. After a tentative decision is made, the Career Connections Center helps students test their choice by participating in externships, internships, co-ops, and career fairs. More Info Map Talk to a College or Department Representative Students should be sure to discuss various academic programs and their potential career implications.

Students can follow-up on long-time personal interests, satisfy intellectual curiosity generated by introductory courses, differentiate their program of study from those of fellow students or enhance their opportunities for employment or for admission to graduate or professional schools. Applying for a Minor Students should review the information about their minor of interest in this catalog. In general, each minor page explains which students are eligible to pursue the minor, any qualifications or prerequisites necessary to be eligible for the minor and the requirements to complete the minor. Students are also encouraged to discuss the minor with the offering department. Students interested in pursuing a minor must complete an application. Students will not be able to earn a minor if an application has not been submitted and approved. The application requires the approval of the student’s college as well as the college offering the minor. Students may apply using the link below. The approval process can take some time, so students are strongly encouraged to apply to pursue a minor early. Apply for a Minor Considerations Students must have at least 45 credits to apply for a minor. Students on college probation cannot apply for a minor. Choosing to add a minor may result in an excess hour surcharge. Students should consult with an academic advisor in their college about how a minor may impact their excess hours assessment.

catalog are identified by prefixes and numbers that were assigned by Florida’s Statewide Course Numbering System (SCNS). This numbering system is used by all public postsecondary institutions in Florida and 27 participating non-public institutions. The major purpose of this system is to facilitate the transfer of courses between participating institutions. Students and administrators can use the online SCNS to obtain course descriptions and specific information about course transfer between participating Florida institutions. More Info Each participating institution controls the title, credit and content of its own courses and recommends the first digit of the course number to indicate the level at which students normally take the course. Course prefixes and the last three digits of the course numbers are assigned by members of faculty discipline committees appointed for that purpose by the Florida Department of Education in Tallahassee. Individuals nominated to serve on these committees are selected to maintain a representative balance as to type of institution and discipline field or specialization. The course prefix and each digit in the course number have a meaning in the SCNS. The listing of prefixes and associated numbers is referred to as the SCNS taxonomy. Descriptions of the content of courses are referred to as statewide course profiles. Example of Course Identifier Example of Course Identifier Prefix Level Code (1st digit) Century Digit (2nd digit) Decade Digit (3rd digit) Unit Digit (4th digit) Lab Code ENC 1 1 0 1 English Composition Lower (Freshman) Level at this institution Freshman Composition Freshman Composition Skills Freshman Composition Skills 1 No laboratory component in this course General Rule for Course Equivalencies Equivalent courses at different institutions are identified by the same prefixes and the same last three digits of the course number and are guaranteed to be transferable between participating institutions that offer the course, with a few exceptions, as listed below in Exceptions to the General Rule for Equivalency. For example, a freshman composition skills course is offered by 59 different postsecondary institutions. Each institution uses ENC_101 to identify its freshman composition skills course. The level code is the first digit and represents the year in which students normally take the course at a specific institution. In the SCNS taxonomy, ENC means English Composition, the century digit 1 represents Freshman Composition, the decade digit 0 represents Freshman Composition Skills and the unit digit 1 represents Freshman Composition Skills 1. In the sciences and certain other areas, a C or L after the course number is known as a lab indicator. The C represents a combined lecture and laboratory course that meets in the same place at the same time. The L represents a laboratory course or the laboratory part of a course that has the same prefix and course number but meets at a different time or place. Transfer of any successfully completed course from one participating institution to another is guaranteed in cases where the course to be transferred is equivalent to one offered by the receiving institution. Equivalencies are established by the same prefix and last three digits and comparable faculty credentials at both institutions. For example, ENC 1101 is offered at a community college. The same course is offered at a state university as ENC 2101. A student who has successfully completed ENC 1101 at the community college is guaranteed to receive transfer credit for ENC 2101 at the state university if the student transfers. The student cannot be required to take ENC 2101 again since ENC 1101 is equivalent to ENC 2101. Transfer credit must be awarded for successfully completed equivalent courses and used by the receiving institution to determine satisfaction of requirements by transfer students on the same basis as credit awarded to the native students. It is the prerogative of the receiving institution, however, to offer transfer credit for courses successfully completed that have not been designated as equivalent. Credit generated at institutions on the quarter-term system may not transfer the equivalent number of credits to institutions on the semester-term system. For example, 4.0 quarter credits often transfers as 2.67 semester credits. About the Course Prefix The course prefix is a three-letter designator for a major division of an academic discipline, subject matter area or subcategory of knowledge. The prefix is not intended to identify the department in which a course is offered. Rather, the content of a course determines the assigned prefix to identify the course. Authority for Acceptance of Equivalent Courses Section 1007.24(7), Florida Statutes, states: Any student who transfers among postsecondary institutions that are fully accredited by a regional or national accrediting agency recognized by the United States Department of Education and that participate in the statewide course numbering system shall be awarded credit by the receiving institution for courses satisfactorily completed by the student at the previous institutions. Credit shall be awarded if the courses are judged by the appropriate statewide course numbering system faculty committees representing school districts, public postsecondary educational institutions and participating non-public postsecondary educational institutions to be academically equivalent to courses offered at the receiving institution, including equivalency of faculty credentials, regardless of the public or non-public control of the previous institution. The Department of Education shall ensure that credits to be accepted by a receiving institution are generated in courses for which the faculty possess credentials that are comparable to those required by the accrediting association of the receiving institution. The award of credit may be limited to courses that are entered in the statewide course numbering system. Credits awarded pursuant to this subsection shall satisfy institutional requirements on the same basis as credits awarded to native students. Exceptions to the General Rule for Equivalency Since the initial implementation of the SCNS, specific disciplines or types of courses have been excepted from the guarantee of transfer for equivalent courses. These include courses that must be evaluated individually or courses in which the student must be evaluated for mastery of skill and technique. The following courses are exceptions to the general rule for course equivalencies and may not transfer. Transferability is at the discretion of the receiving institution. Courses not offered by the receiving institution For courses at non-regionally accredited institutions, courses offered prior to the established transfer date of the course in question Courses in the _900-999 series are not automatically transferable, and must be evaluated individually. These include such courses as Special Topics, Internships, Apprenticeships, Practica, Study Abroad, Theses and Dissertations. College preparatory and vocational preparatory courses Graduate courses Internships, apprenticeships, practica, clinical experiences and study abroad courses with numbers other than those ranging from 900-999. Applied courses in the performing arts (Art, Dance, Interior Design, Music and Theatre) and skills courses in Criminal Justice (academy certificate courses) are not guaranteed as transferable. These courses need evidence of achievement (e.g., portfolio, audition, interview, etc.). Courses at Non-regionally Accredited Institutions The SCNS makes available on its home page (in the Latest News box) a report entitled Courses at Non-regionally Accredited Institutions that contains a comprehensive listing of all non-public institution courses in the SCNS inventory, as well as each course’s transfer level and transfer effective date. This report is updated monthly.

Payments to Students It is crucial that payments to students are handled correctly for HEA (Higher Education Act) compliance because inaccuracies or omissions can jeopardize the institution’s eligibility to participate in federal student aid programs, potentially affecting the financial aid availability for the students and inviting severe legal repercussions for the institution. Correct handling of student payments is also vital for tax purposes, as any discrepancies can lead to substantial penalties for both the institution and the students, and can compromise the financial integrity and reputation of the institution.

Through participating in group, students can gain insight into their own thoughts and behaviors, be inspired by each other’s growth, and offer/receive feedback and support!If you're interested in group counseling services, check out our groups page to see which will be active next semester, and then call us (352-392-1575) or access our online scheduling portal to schedule a brief consultation!
